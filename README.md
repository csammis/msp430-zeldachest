Code for the Texas Instruments MSP430G2211 running the logic for a treasure chest that I made for my wife on Christmas 2012. RAM limitations of the microcontroller mean I couldn't make a nice PCM sampled sound play when the chest opened, but it buzzes out the pretty-much-right frequencies using PWM. She liked it so mission accomplished!
